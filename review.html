<h1>
	Papaya	
</h1>
<p>
	Tiny little eatery in 14 St Anne's Ct in Soho (W1F 0BD). After 4 years of knowing them, the massive box of food only costs £4.50, which is only 50 pence more than what it was 4 years ago.

<h1>
	Kati Roll
</h1>
<p>
	With a small sitting area in 24 Poland Street with lovely Bollywood decorations. The best thing about Kati Roll is that you will never be full on one single roll. You will need at least two, which means you will get to taste at least two different ones. Conveniently, there is a discount for 2 rolls purchased together. Although not as cheap as it used to anymore, you can still have a decently filled stomach for £8 (and masala chai is still £1.10).
</p>
<h1>
	The Potato Project
</h1>
<p>
	At 27 Noel Street, Potato Project goes all experimental on a lovely classic, jacket potato. You can have a decent, filling lunch for £6. They try sweet potatoes and seafood (other than canned tuna) which is a very nice variation and it is my favourite.
