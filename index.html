<h1> Kensington </h1>

<h2> Sticky Fingers </h2>

<p> Founded by Bill Wyman, The Rolling Stones legendary bass player. Prepare to get your hands and face mucky, and get stuck into all your favourites; burgers, ribs, mac ‘n’ cheese, you name it. I’d recommend heading there on a Monday to join their ‘Monday Madness’, where you can get up to 50% off the menu - Sticky fingers classic burger with your choice of sides for only £5.48 how can you say no? They also have a wide range of creative cocktails and shakes which is a must, not to mention an extensive list of quality beers, wines and soft drinks. 
Of course with rock star Bill Wyman's influence, you're sure to have some good tunes to enjoy your meal to. </p>

<H2> Lyric Square Farmers Market </H2>

<p> Every Thursday the Lyric Square in hammersmith hosts a farmers market which has a wide range of mouthwatering food stands from all over the world. Expect pasta dishes, Caribbean style dishes, hot dogs, burgers, Thai cuisine, crepes, pastries, cakes, falafals (but be wary of queues for this one!) and many more all at decent prices. Once there you'll be mesmerized all the different smells, the sound of chatter and laughter from the upbeat staff and in the summer they line up picnic  tables encouraging a communal atmosphere, a great place for people to meet on their lunch breaks, to catch up with old friends or even a hot date. </p>

8am-5pm

<H2> 222 </H2>

<P> 222 is a veggie/vegan resturant on North End road West Kensington. During the week they have a lunch time buffet between 12pm and 3.30pm which costs £9.50 or £7.50 for a take away so its not the cheapest lunch around but for the quality, health and tastiness its definitely worth it. Their chef Ben makes delicious and creative meals to excite anyones tastebuds whether you are vegan or non-vegan, it can be quite a wait in the evening, but this is because the food is made fresh and has a lot of care and attention put into it- if you don't like to wait the lunch buffett is definitely best for you. The resturant has a relaxed atmosphere, with friendly staff and a diverse croud, I recommend you book a table to avoid disapointment. </P>
